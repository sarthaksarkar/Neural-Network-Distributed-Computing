# Neural-Network-Distributed-computing
In this code I am implementing a neural network in the server code where server code is implementing a hidden layer with number of neurons given by the client and the client also provides the learning rate and number of iterations along with the type of problem(regression, classification and multi-class classification) and the server the labels for the given test data.
